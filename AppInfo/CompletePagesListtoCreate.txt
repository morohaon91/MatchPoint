Implementation Notes
1.	Next.js Dynamic Routing 
	Use Next.js dynamic routes for pages with IDs (e.g., [groupId], [gameId])
	Implement proper loading states and error handling
2.	Responsive Design 
	Ensure all pages work well on mobile devices
	Consider mobile-first design for key interactions
3.	Component Reuse 
	Create reusable components for common elements: 
	Group cards
	Game cards
	User avatars
	Forms
	Lists
4.	Progressive Enhancement 
	Start with minimal viable versions of each page
	Add advanced features incrementally
	Focus on core user flows first
