Permissions Rules for Sports Team Organizer App
Core Permission System
The app uses a role-based permissions model where access is determined by group membership and assigned roles:
•	Group membership determines basic access to groups, games, and related content
•	Roles within groups (admin, organizer, member) define specific action permissions
•	Composite key structure (groupId_userId) enables efficient permission verification
Role Hierarchy
1.	Admin 
	Full control over group settings and membership
	Can create and manage games/events
	Can assign other members as organizers
2.	Organizer 
	Can create and manage games/events
	Can handle registrations and team assignments
	Cannot modify group settings or membership
3.	Member 
	Can view group content and join games
	Can participate in chats and discussions
	Cannot create games or modify group structure
Performance Optimization Strategies
Data Denormalization
•	Store role information in multiple places to reduce permission checks
•	Include basic group info directly in game documents
•	Maintain counters (member count, etc.) at document level
•	Duplicate critical fields to minimize cross-collection reads
Client-Side Caching
•	Cache user roles and permissions in React context
•	Implement React Query or SWR for data fetching with caching
•	Store membership information in localStorage for initial rendering
•	Use optimistic UI updates with proper validation
Security Rule Implementation
Key Security Rule Patterns
javascript
// Check if user is group member
function isGroupMember(groupId) {
  return request.auth != null && 
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/groupMembers/$(groupId)_$(request.auth.uid));
}

// Check if user is group admin
function isGroupAdmin(groupId) {
  return isGroupMember(groupId) &&
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groupMembers/$(groupId)_$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
}
Comprehensive Testing Strategy
•	Use Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing of security rules
•	Create test scripts that verify all permission scenarios
•	Test each rule with allowed and disallowed users
•	Validate complex queries and edge cases
•	Simulate different user roles and actions
Firebase Emulator Integration
•	Set up Firebase Emulator in development environment
•	Create test data seeds for different permission scenarios
•	Test security rules in isolation from app logic
•	Verify rule performance and optimize where needed
•	Run automated tests against emulator before deployment
Client-Side Access Control
•	UI elements conditionally rendered based on user role
•	Navigation options limited by permission level
•	Form submit actions validated against permissions before execution
•	Realtime updates filtered by permission scope
This permission system provides multi-group functionality with strong security boundaries while maintaining Firebase compatibility, avoiding the need for true multi-tenancy architecture.
